<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I graduated with a bachelor's degree from Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen) and am currently a PhD student in School of Data Science at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK(SZ)) and fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Pinjia He](https://pinjiahe.github.io/).

My research centers on software reliability, security and observability through innovative testing and monitoring methodologies. 

I warmly welcome collaborations and discussions in this domain (DevOps, MLOps, LLMOps, AI4SE, SE4AI).
